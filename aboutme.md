### My story

I came to USA back in 2012 to work as a Life Guard at a public pool during the summer.
However, I liked it so much here that I decided to stay, learn English and obtain the Higher Education.
So, here I am, on my way to earn a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and trying to look for a place to implement what I've learned so far :-)
<!-- To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.-->
