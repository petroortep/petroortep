### My story

I came to USA back in 2012 to work as a Life Guard at a public pool during the summer.
However, I liked it so much here that I decided to stay, learn English and obtain the Higher Education.
So, here I am, on my way to earn a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and trying to look for a place to implement what I've learned so far :-)

### Before the USA

###### I have been a member of the Folk Dance Group for 10 years:
